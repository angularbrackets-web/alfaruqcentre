# Information Verification Protocols

## üö® CRITICAL INCIDENT ANALYSIS

**Date**: 2025-08-12
**Issue**: Railway free tier misinformation
**Impact**: Wasted time on setup for non-existent free tier
**Root Cause**: Relying on outdated training data without real-time verification

---

## üîí MANDATORY VERIFICATION PROTOCOLS

### 1. NEVER TRUST TRAINING DATA FOR:
- ‚ùå Platform pricing (always changes)
- ‚ùå Feature availability (frequently updated)
- ‚ùå Free tier existence (often discontinued)
- ‚ùå API endpoints and limits
- ‚ùå Software versions and compatibility
- ‚ùå Service URLs and domains

### 2. ALWAYS SEARCH BEFORE RECOMMENDING:
```
RULE: Before recommending ANY platform/service, MUST:
1. WebSearch for "[platform] pricing 2025"
2. WebSearch for "[platform] free tier current"
3. Check official documentation via WebFetch
4. Verify with multiple sources
```

### 3. MANDATORY SEARCH TRIGGERS:
- **Hosting platforms**: Railway, Render, Vercel, Netlify, etc.
- **Database services**: Supabase, PlanetScale, MongoDB Atlas, etc.
- **API services**: Any external service with pricing
- **Framework versions**: Next.js, React, etc. compatibility
- **Deployment costs**: Any cost-related claims

## üîç REAL-TIME VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

### Before ANY Platform Recommendation:
- [ ] Search current pricing
- [ ] Verify free tier existence
- [ ] Check service status/availability
- [ ] Confirm feature capabilities
- [ ] Cross-reference with official docs

### Before Creating Setup Instructions:
- [ ] Verify all steps with current documentation
- [ ] Test commands are still valid
- [ ] Confirm environment variables/configuration
- [ ] Check for platform-specific changes

## üìã AGENT HANDOFF REQUIREMENTS

### For Future Agents in This Project:
1. **READ THIS FILE FIRST** before making any platform recommendations
2. **Use WebSearch/WebFetch** for all time-sensitive information
3. **Never assume** pricing or availability from training data
4. **Always verify** before creating setup documentation

### Critical Information to Always Verify:
- Hosting platform pricing and free tiers
- Database service limits and costs
- API rate limits and pricing
- Framework compatibility
- Service availability in user's region

---

## üõ°Ô∏è CROSS-SESSION PROTECTION

### Project Memory System (CLAUDE.md):
- Record all verified platform information with dates
- Document known working solutions with verification dates
- Flag outdated information for re-verification

### Session Handoff Notes:
- Always include verification status of recommendations
- Note when information was last verified
- Warn about potentially outdated training data

---

## üéØ SPECIFIC LESSONS LEARNED

### Railway Incident:
- **Error**: Assumed free tier existed based on training data
- **Correction**: Railway costs $5/month minimum (verified 2025-08-12)
- **Future Action**: Always search "[platform] pricing 2025" first

### Verified Alternatives (as of 2025-08-12):
- **Render**: Free tier with limitations (750 hours/month)
- **Vercel**: Free tier for frontend (no persistent storage)
- **Supabase**: Free PostgreSQL tier (50MB limit)

---

## üîÑ CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT

### Monthly Verification:
- Re-verify all recommended platforms
- Update known working solutions
- Remove outdated information

### Incident Response:
- Document all misinformation incidents
- Analyze root causes
- Update verification protocols

---

## ‚ö° EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS

### If Uncertain About Information:
1. **STOP** and search immediately
2. **STATE UNCERTAINTY**: "Let me verify current information"
3. **SEARCH FIRST**: Use WebSearch/WebFetch
4. **VERIFY MULTIPLE SOURCES**: Cross-reference results
5. **DOCUMENT FINDINGS**: Update project memory

### Red Flags (Immediate Search Required):
- Any mention of "free tier"
- Specific pricing amounts
- Platform feature claims
- Service availability
- API endpoints or limits

**üéØ GOAL**: Zero misinformation incidents through systematic verification**
