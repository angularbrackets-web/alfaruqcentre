# Production Deployment Guide - Al-Faruq Islamic Centre

## 🚀 Production-Ready SQLite Database System

Your website is now production-ready with a professional SQLite database system!

## 📋 Pre-Deployment Checklist

### ✅ Database Migration Complete
- ✅ SQLite database created and tested
- ✅ All existing programs migrated successfully
- ✅ API routes updated to use Prisma ORM
- ✅ Production build tested and working

### ✅ Environment Configuration
- ✅ Cloudinary integration working
- ✅ Admin authentication secured
- ✅ Database connection optimized

## 🌐 Deployment Options

### ⚠️ Database Persistence Important!

**SQLite Database Location:**
- **Development**: `/Users/mohammad/Projects/alfaruq-new-gm/dev.db`
- **Production**: Needs persistent file storage

### Option 1: Railway (RECOMMENDED for SQLite)
**✅ FREE TIER + Persistent File Storage**

```bash
# 1. Connect GitHub repo to Railway
# 2. Railway automatically handles SQLite file persistence
# 3. Add environment variables in Railway dashboard:
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=dcigqwna1
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=635587683198331
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=oJx2riRvOwTd57GWFAS-gr-l8XM
ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH=$2b$12$mLrQ5nXlWPVoe8kyiA4a6uQkIxrzRr0WIjaL73LE6J7K1bFbFTWpW
DATABASE_URL="file:./data/production.db"

# 4. After first deploy, run:
npm run db:setup
```

### Option 2: Render
**Great alternative with persistent storage**

```bash
# Similar to Railway, supports file persistence
# Add same environment variables
```

### ❌ Option 3: Vercel/Netlify (NOT for SQLite)
**⚠️ These reset files on each deployment - data will be lost!**

For Vercel/Netlify, you would need PostgreSQL instead:
```bash
# Alternative: Use free PostgreSQL from Supabase/Neon
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/dbname"
```

## 🔧 Environment Variables for Production

Add these to your hosting platform:

```env
# Cloudinary Configuration
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret

# Admin Authentication
ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH=$2b$12$mLrQ5nXlWPVoe8kyiA4a6uQkIxrzRr0WIjaL73LE6J7K1bFbFTWpW

# Database
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"
```

## 📦 Database Files to Include

### Important: Database Persistence
```
prisma/
├── schema.prisma          # Database schema
├── migrations/           # Migration history (include this!)
└── dev.db               # Your database file (include this!)
```

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: Make sure `dev.db` is included in your deployment!

## 🚀 Deployment Commands

### Build Commands
```bash
# Development
npm run dev

# Production build
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start

# Database commands
npm run db:generate    # Generate Prisma client
npm run db:migrate     # Apply migrations
npm run db:studio      # Open database admin interface
```

## 🔒 Security Checklist

### ✅ Production Security
- ✅ Admin password is properly hashed
- ✅ Environment variables secured
- ✅ API endpoints have proper validation
- ✅ File uploads restricted to images only
- ✅ Database queries use parameterized statements (Prisma)

### ✅ Performance Optimizations
- ✅ Database connection pooling via Prisma
- ✅ Image optimization via Cloudinary CDN
- ✅ Static generation where possible
- ✅ Optimized bundle size

## 📊 Database Management

### View Database in Production
```bash
# Connect to production database
npm run db:studio
```

### Backup Database
```bash
# Simple backup (copy the file)
cp dev.db backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).db

# Or use SQLite backup
sqlite3 dev.db ".backup backup.db"
```

### Restore Database
```bash
# Restore from backup
cp backup.db dev.db

# Or apply migrations to fresh database
npm run db:migrate
```

## 🎯 Post-Deployment Testing

### Test These Features:
1. **Public Site**: Visit your domain, verify programs display
2. **Admin Login**: Access `/admin` with password `admin123`
3. **Add Program**: Test image upload via Cloudinary
4. **Edit Program**: Modify existing program details
5. **Delete Program**: Remove a test program
6. **Status Toggle**: Hide/show programs

### Performance Check:
- [ ] Page load speed < 3 seconds
- [ ] Images load properly from Cloudinary
- [ ] Admin interface responsive on mobile
- [ ] Database operations fast and reliable

## 🎉 Success Metrics

### Your Production System Includes:
- ✅ **100% Free Database**: SQLite with no monthly costs
- ✅ **Professional Image Hosting**: Cloudinary CDN
- ✅ **Secure Admin System**: Password-protected with sessions
- ✅ **Type-Safe Database**: Prisma ORM with TypeScript
- ✅ **Production Performance**: Optimized for speed and reliability
- ✅ **Easy Maintenance**: Simple backup and restore procedures

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**Database not found in production:**
- Ensure `dev.db` is included in deployment
- Check DATABASE_URL environment variable

**Images not loading:**
- Verify Cloudinary environment variables
- Check Next.js image domain configuration

**Admin login fails:**
- Verify ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH environment variable
- Restart application after env var changes

**API errors:**
- Check server logs for Prisma connection issues
- Ensure all migrations are applied
