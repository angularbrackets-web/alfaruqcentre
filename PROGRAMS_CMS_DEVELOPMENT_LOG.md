## üìù DETAILED CHANGE LOG

### Session 1 - 2025-08-11
**Agent**: Previous Agent
**Duration**: Full session
**Focus**: Building Dynamic Programs CMS (All Phases Complete)

#### Changes Made:
- **Installed Dependencies**: Added Cloudinary SDK and bcryptjs for file uploads and authentication
- **Created Type System**: Added comprehensive TypeScript interfaces in `app/types/program.ts`
- **Data Structure**: Created `app/data/programs.json` with existing program data
- **Updated PosterGallery**: Modified to use dynamic data source from JSON
- **API Endpoints**: Built complete CRUD API in `app/api/programs/` and `app/api/programs/[id]/`
- **File Upload API**: Implemented Cloudinary integration in `app/api/upload/`
- **Authentication System**: Built simple password-based auth with session management
- **Admin Layout**: Created protected admin layout with navigation and responsive design
- **Admin Dashboard**: Built admin dashboard with stats and quick actions
- **Programs Management**: Created admin programs list with status toggles and actions

#### Decisions & Rationale:
- **JSON-based data storage**: Chosen over database for simplicity and quick implementation
- **Cloudinary for media**: Professional CDN with automatic optimization
- **Simple session auth**: Cookie-based sessions sufficient for single admin use
- **File-based API**: Using filesystem operations for data persistence
- **Component composition**: Breaking admin into reusable components

#### Technical Implementation Details:
- **Data Flow**: JSON file ‚Üí API routes ‚Üí Frontend components
- **File Structure**: Organized admin routes under `/app/admin/` with protected layout
- **Authentication**: HTTP-only cookies with base64 encoded session tokens
- **Image Handling**: Cloudinary upload with validation and error handling
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch blocks with user-friendly messages

#### Files Created/Modified:
- `app/types/program.ts` - TypeScript interfaces
- `app/data/programs.json` - Data storage
- `app/utils/programs.ts` - Data utility functions  
- `app/components/PosterGallery.tsx` - Updated to use dynamic data
- `app/api/programs/route.ts` - Programs API endpoints
- `app/api/programs/[id]/route.ts` - Individual program operations
- `app/api/upload/route.ts` - Cloudinary upload handling
- `app/api/auth/[login,logout,verify]/route.ts` - Authentication APIs
- `app/hooks/useAuth.ts` - Authentication React hook
- `app/components/AdminAuth.tsx` - Authentication component
- `app/admin/layout.tsx` - Protected admin layout
- `app/admin/page.tsx` - Admin dashboard
- `app/admin/programs/page.tsx` - Programs management page
- `.env.example` - Environment variables template

#### Implementation Phases Completed:
- ‚úÖ **Phase 1**: Foundation complete (data structure, types, API)
- ‚úÖ **Phase 2**: API infrastructure complete (CRUD operations, file upload)  
- ‚úÖ **Phase 3**: Authentication complete (login, session management)
- ‚úÖ **Phase 4**: Admin layout and programs list complete
- ‚úÖ **Phase 5**: Add/Edit forms complete (Cloudinary integration working)
- ‚úÖ **Phase 6**: Final integration and testing complete

#### Final Implementation Completed:
- **Add Program Form**: Full-featured form with image upload, validation, and error handling
- **Edit Program Form**: Complete editing with image replacement capabilities
- **Delete Functionality**: Implemented with confirmation dialogs
- **API Integration**: Public site now uses API endpoints instead of static JSON
- **Build Verification**: All TypeScript errors resolved, successful production build
- **Loading States**: Comprehensive loading and error states throughout application

#### FEATURE COMPLETE ‚úÖ
All 15 planned tasks completed successfully. The Dynamic Programs CMS is fully functional.
